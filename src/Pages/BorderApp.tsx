        <h2>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

        We don't collect or store any personal data from you while you use our application. However, we do utilize Google Analytics to understand how our application is used and to improve it. Google Analytics collects statistical data about our users' behavior in our Application, but it does not identify individual users to us.

        <h2>2. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

        The only purpose for which we use the data collected via Google Analytics is to improve our Application, and to understand what our users prefer. This statistical data does not allow us to identify you personally.

        <h2>3. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>

        Our Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to take necessary actions.

        <h2>4. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
