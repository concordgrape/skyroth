          <p>Welcome to our privacy policy.
          <br></br>
          We value your trust and are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we handle your information when you use Lil.Cards. By using Lil.Cards, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p><br></br>

                  <h2>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
  
                  a. **No Personal Identifying Information**: We do not collect, store, or otherwise process any personal identifying information (such as your name, email address, physical location, contacts, or photos) that could directly identify you.
  
                  b. **Flashcard Data (Local Storage)**: All your flashcard data, including the content of your cards and decks, is stored **exclusively on your device**. It is not transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers. You own and control your flashcard data entirely, and it resides solely on your device.
  
                  c. **Anonymized Usage Data (via Firebase Analytics)**: To help us understand how users interact with the App and to improve its functionality and user experience, we utilize Google Analytics for Firebase. This service collects **basic, anonymized, and non-personally identifiable usage data**. This may include:
                    - App launch events
                    - Screen views (e.g., which sections of the app are visited)
                    - Interactions with app features (e.g., "card created," "deck opened")
                    - Device type and operating system version
                    - Crash reports and performance data (to help us identify and fix bugs)
                  <br></br><br></br>
                  This data is aggregated and does not identify you personally. It is used solely for internal analysis. For a better understanding of what data Google Analytics collects and how it is used, we recommend that you review Google's privacy policy at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.
  
                  <h2>2. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
  
                  We use the information collected for the following purposes:
  
                    a. To understand overall app usage trends.
  
                    b. To improve and optimize app features and design.
  
                    c. To identify and fix bugs or crashes to enhance app stability.
  
                  <h2>3. DATA STORAGE</h2>
  
                  All your personal flashcard data resides locally on your device only. We do not store your flashcard data on our servers.
                  <br></br><br></br>
                  The anonymized usage data mentioned in Section 1c is processed and stored by Google Firebase for analytics purposes, as per their privacy policy.
  
                  <h2>4. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
  
                  Lil.Cards is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately, and we will take steps to remove such information from our records (though, as stated, we do not collect personal identifying information).
  
                  <h2>5. SECURITY</h2>
  
                  All your flashcard data is stored locally on your device. The security of this data is dependent on the security measures you have implemented on your device (e.g., device passcodes, encryption). We recommend using device passcodes and other security features provided by your device's operating system.
                  <br></br><br></br>
                  As we do not store your flashcard data on our servers, we cannot be responsible for its loss if your device is lost, stolen, damaged, or otherwise compromised. While no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is entirely secure, we take reasonable measures to protect the anonymized usage data collected via Firebase.
  
                  <h2>6. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
  
                  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated Privacy Policy on Lil.Cards or through other appropriate means. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
